# Sun Bird Urban Noise in Uganda

## About the Data

This dataset contains urban noise pollution measurements collected from two major Ugandan cities: Kampala and Entebbe. 

The data captures noise levels (in decibels) from various sources across urban environments, providing insights into the diverse contributors to noise pollution.

The dataset includes 1,000 observations across 11 variables, documenting noise measurements from 20 different source classes including motor vehicle sirens, herbalists, street preachers, bars and nightclubs, generators, hawkers and vendors, fabrication workshops, community radio stations, religious venues, and construction sites. 

This comprehensive dataset enables analysis of urban soundscapes, identification of major noise pollution sources, and examination of spatial patterns in noise distribution across different urban contexts in Uganda.
